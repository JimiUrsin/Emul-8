# Emul-8
A CHIP-8 emulator (/interpreter) created with SDL in C++.

This program was built to help me learn CMake, SDL, and Google Testing

## Current features
At this point the program can run the IBM Logo program. Drawing on the screen works but has not been fully implemented yet (no collision, no XORing pixels yet).

## User instructions
### Windows
- Download the latest Emul-8.exe from releases
- Make sure SDL2.dll exists in the same folder as the .exe (or in your PATH, if you prefer)
- Run the program from the command line, with a Chip-8 binary file's name as an argument
- When you're done, close the window and the program will exit

### Linux
- Coming later

## Thanks
[Cowgod's Chip-8 Technical Reference](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM) has been a big help in explaining the technical details of the Chip-8
