# Emul-8
A CHIP-8 emulator (/interpreter) created with SDL in C++.

This program was built to help me learn CMake, SDL, and Google Testing

## Current features
Almost all instructions have been implemented, and everything is mostly working

## User instructions
### Windows
- Download the latest Emul-8.exe from releases
- Make sure 32-bit SDL2.dll exists in the same folder as the .exe (SDL2.dll be found [here](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) under "Runtime Binaries")
- Run the program from the command line, with a Chip-8 binary file's name as an argument (you can also give a filename at runtime)
- When you're done, close the window and the program will exit

### Linux
- Coming later

[Cowgod's Chip-8 Technical Reference](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM) has been a big help in explaining the technical details of the Chip-8
